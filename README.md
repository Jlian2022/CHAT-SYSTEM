Students are required to create a chat application in C following the client/server architecture and the concepts of socket programming. The chart application should support multiple users who can join the chat room. If a user sends a message, everyone in the chatroom should receive the message.

 

This project will explore chat applications:

The application should be built with three main components:
Server class,
Communication class,
Client app/component
The application should enable multiple clients to send/receive messages simultaneously. 
The client interface should be GUI. However, console-based UI will also be acceptable.
